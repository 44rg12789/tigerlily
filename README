===============================================================================

Installing
----------
TigerLily requires Perl 5.6.1 or greater.  You will also need
Curses.pm or Term::Readline::Gnu. (from CPAN)

You can run tlily directly from the source directory, by running
"perl tlily.PL".

To create an assortment of single file versions of tlily, run:

perl Makefile.PL
make

Pick the .plx you want to use (depends on the UI you wish to use, it's part
of the file name), and copy it wherever you wish.

Note: Historically you could install the client, but that is broken.
For now, please run the client from the source directory.
