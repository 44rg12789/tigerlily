To Do
-----

Before 2.0 release:
  when the last open server connection is closed, provide a exit/reconnect
  option. (integrate with smartexit feature)
  
  The following need to be ported/written.  Most should be pretty easy to do
  based on the ones we've already finished.

  helper.pl     (waiting for coke's patches)
  pipes.pl      (medium)
  program.pl    (medium)
  ctc.pl/httpd.pl/Httpd.pm  (steve is working on this)

  New functionality:
    Makefile.PL   (albert is working on this)  
    Key bindings need to be moved into tlily.global
    
  Bugs:
    log.pl - doesn't do indenting/wrapping right.  damien will move the 
             wrapping/indenting code out of Curses.pm and into the UI.

    README is incorrect on color setup.. probably other things.
    

Later:
  multiserver, multiui
  irc mode/ TLily::Server::SubClient
