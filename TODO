To Do
-----

  when the last open server connection is closed, provide a exit/reconnect
      option. (integrate with smartexit feature)
  helper.pl
  multiserver, multiui
  irc mode/ TLily::Server::SubClient
  thread extension?
     after [;:], if you press some key, have it insert [xxx], where xxx
     is a scrollable list of threads seen in the discussion?
  lilyBot support
  TLily::Command has been merged into TLily::Server::SLCP.  Still need to
    convert all remaining items using the old cmd_process to the new one.
    And eventually remove TLily/Command.pm
  I need to add passive mode to the %ctc support.
