To Do
-----

Before 2.0 release:
  when the last open server connection is closed, provide a exit/reconnect
  option, instead of error messages (integrate with smartexit feature)
  
  The following need to be ported/written.  Most should be pretty easy to do
  based on the ones we've already finished.
  
  autoreply.pl  (easy)
  run_command.pl(easy)  
  mirror.pl     (easy)
  countdown.pl  (easy)
  stock.pl      (easy)
  helper.pl     (pretty easy)
  hidesend.pl   (medium)
  pipes.pl      (medium)
  view.pl       (medium)
  program.pl    (medium)
  ctc.pl/httpd.pl/Httpd.pm  (hard)
  log.pl        (requires UI support)
  gag.pl        (requires UI support)
  
  The following need to be tested!:
  biff.pl
  
Later:
  multiserver, multiui
  irc mode/ TLily::Server::SubClient
