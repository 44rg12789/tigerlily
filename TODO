To Do
-----

Before 2.0 release:
  
  The following need to be ported/written.  Most should be pretty easy to do
  based on the ones we've already finished.

  pipes.pl

  New functionality:
    - Makefile.PL   (albert is working on this)  
    - when the last open server connection is closed, provide a exit/reconnect
      option. (integrate with smartexit feature)

Bug Fixes:
   autoreview - frank mentioned this had a problem?

Later:
  helper.pl/program.pl
  multiserver, multiui
  irc mode/ TLily::Server::SubClient
  thread extension?
     after [;:], if you press some key, have it insert [xxx], where xxx
     is a scrollable list of threads seen in the discussion?
  lilyBot support
  I want to rewrite TLily::Command.  It needs to make more sense, I think.
  I need to add passive mode to the %ctc support.
