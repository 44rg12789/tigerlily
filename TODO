To Do
-----

Before 2.0 release:
  
  The following need to be ported/written.  Most should be pretty easy to do
  based on the ones we've already finished.

  helper.pl     (waiting for coke's patches)
  pipes.pl      (medium)
  program.pl    (medium)
  ctc.pl/httpd.pl/Httpd.pm  (steve is working on this)
			    (steve is almost done with this)

  New functionality:
    - Makefile.PL   (albert is working on this)  
    - when the last open server connection is closed, provide a exit/reconnect
      option. (integrate with smartexit feature)
      
  Testing:
    - autoreview is untested!

  Bugs:
    log.pl - doesn't do indenting/wrapping right.  damien will move the 
             wrapping/indenting code out of Curses.pm and into the UI.
	     
 autologin - doesn't work after the first use

Later:
  multiserver, multiui
  irc mode/ TLily::Server::SubClient
  thread extension?
     after [;:], if you press some key, have it insert [xxx], where xxx
     is a scrollable list of threads seen in the discussion?
  lilyBot support
