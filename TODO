To Do
-----

 -  when the last open server connection is closed, provide a exit/reconnect
      option. (integrate with smartexit feature)
 -  multiserver, multiui
 -  irc mode/ TLily::Server::SubClient
 -  thread extension?
     after [;:], if you press some key, have it insert [xxx], where xxx
     is a scrollable list of threads seen in the discussion?
 -  lilyBot support
 -  Need to add passive mode to the %ctc support.    
 -  Fix all occurances of outdated refs to einstein.org.
 -  Perhaps a method of procuring help for an extension file, regardless
    if it's load?
