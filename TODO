To Do
-----

Before 2.0 release:
  
  The following need to be ported/written.  Most should be pretty easy to do
  based on the ones we've already finished.

  helper.pl     (waiting for coke's patches)
  pipes.pl      (medium)
  program.pl    (medium)
  ctc.pl/httpd.pl/Httpd.pm  (steve is working on this)

  New functionality:
    - Makefile.PL   (albert is working on this)  
    - when the last open server connection is closed, provide a exit/reconnect
      option. (integrate with smartexit feature)
      
  Testing:
    - autoreview is untested!

  Bugs:
    UI     - if UI is suspended (for example C-z), when it comes back, the 
             cursor keys don't work.
	     after C-z, %keyname tells me that left arrow is M-[. 
  
    log.pl - doesn't do indenting/wrapping right.  damien will move the 
             wrapping/indenting code out of Curses.pm and into the UI.

Later:
  multiserver, multiui
  irc mode/ TLily::Server::SubClient
