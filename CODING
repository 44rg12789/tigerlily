Tigerlily Coding Standards  (Such as they are)
--------------------------

After yet another debate over indent width, we decided to write up
some basic coding standards for tlily.  Feel free to add to this as
you see fit.   Not all of our code will fully adhere, but it probably
should eventually.  Feel free to help out with cleaning things up..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Memory Usage

Tigerlily is a memory hog.  It always will be.  However, we do have a
few things to say on how to avoid making it trully horrendous:

   - When possible, import just the symbols you need from a module.
     For example, let's say you wanted the POSIX "tolower" function.
     A "use POSIX" adds 1224k to perl on solaris sparc.  If you do a
     "use POSIX qw(tolower);" will save you 300k.

   - Which brings us to.. POSIX.pm is a hog, even if you do
     selectively import symbols.  Try to avoid it if you can.  In the
     above example, perl's lc() would be a much better choice :)

   - Avoid @EXPORT in your modules.  Try to just use EXPORT_OK.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Bracing

This is the bracing style we want to use:

    if ($foo == 1) {
        do_some_stuff
        . . . 
    } else {
        do_some_other_stuff
        . . . 
    }

Variations on this theme are fine... examples:

    if ($foo == 1) { call_a_function(); }

    call_a_function() if ($foo == 1);


What I don't want to see is:

    if ($foo == 1)
    {
       . . .
    }

This style wastes space.  I will mercilessly reformat code that I see
that uses this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Indenting

We have decided to use 4 space indents.  This means 4 spaces. 
Don't change your tab stops no matter what.  A tab is 8 spaces.

Emacs will indent the code correctly if you use cperl-mode (perl-mode
is probably more or less ok as well, but we recommend cperl-mode)

To make emacs use a 4 space indent in cperl mode, put the following in 
your ~/.emacs file:

(setq cperl-indent-level 4) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Prototypes

Perl permits you to define functions with prototypes (for example, sub
foo($) defines foo to take a single scalar argument).  Perl function
prototyping is not, however, intended to act in any way like C function
prototyping.  It exists to permit the creation of functions which act
like Perl builtin functions, rather than to provide argument checking.

Do not use function prototypes unless you have a clear understanding
of what they are for and why you want them.  If you think you want
prototypes on all your functions, you are probably wrong.

See perlsub(1) for more information on prototypes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Help text

Every user command you register should have both a short description
(shelp_r) and a help page (help_r) associated with it.  Help pages
for commands should follow this form:

| help_r("command" => "
| Usage: %command options
|        %command other options
| 
| Description of how to use the command, possibly spanning \
| multiple lines.
| 
| (see also %othercommand)
| ";

Note that you should not word wrap paragraphs which span more than one line:
the UI is quite capable of doing this for you, and will get it right on
different screen widths.  You may wish to separate lines with a \\n (as
above) to keep things nice and tidy in your code.

On the same note, the help manager will automatically remove any unneeded
newlines from the start and end of your help text, so feel free to add some
if it makes things look nicer for you.  (Again, see above.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Object data

UI and server objects are hashrefs.  Occasionally, an extension author may
want to stick a bit of private data into one of these objects.  This is
permitted.  Extension-private hash keys should begin with "_", and care
must be taken for different extensions to not accidentally use the same
key.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Other

There's plenty of room for more stuff in here.. Go for it :)
