Curses
------

  If you want to run the command line version, and you don't already have
Curses.pm installed, you will need to download, build and install Curses.pm
from CPAN (www.cpan.org).

  As of version 1.13, Curses.pm is broken out of the box on OS/X.  To fix
it, do the following after untarring it:
  $ cd hints
  $ cp c-freebsd.ncurses.h c-darwin.h
and then build as normal:
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  # make install
